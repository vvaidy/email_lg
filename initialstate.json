{"customer_email": "Hi There,\n\nI had a wonderful time at your resort last week. The only glitch was that I had\na poor experience at the front desk with the lady there, I think her name\nwas Eleanor Rigby. If you like, you could check with Father MacKenzie who witnessed\nthe entire incident.\n\nOther than that I had a wonderful time although I have to say that the rain did\nput quite a damper on things. What might be a better time for me to visit?\nI like to follow the sun!\n\nPaul", "organizational_settings": "You work at a wellness and meditation resort located just outside London, England.\nYour resort is high end and caters to a discerning and affluent clientele.", "research_info": null, "agent_instructions": {"price_enquiry": "then try to look up the pricing info they requested.", "customer_complaint": "then try to assure we value them and that we are addressing their issues.", "product_enquiry": "then try to use the provided research given as RESEARCH_INFO in a succinct, polite and friendly way.", "customer_feedback": "then try to assure we value them and that we are addressing their issues."}, "agent_descriptions": {"price_enquiry": "used when someone is asking for information about pricing", "customer_complaint": "used when someone is complaining about something", "product_enquiry": "used when someone is asking for information about a product feature", "customer_feedback": "used when someone is giving feedback about a product"}, "num_steps": 0, "agent_settings": "You are a master at working out the best keywords to search for in a web search to get the best info for the customer service agents to respond in a helpful manner.", "model": "llama-3.1-70b-versatile", "responder_signature": "Sarah the Resident Manager", "polite_wait": "Thank you for your email.\nWe are currently reviewing your message and will respond shortly."}
